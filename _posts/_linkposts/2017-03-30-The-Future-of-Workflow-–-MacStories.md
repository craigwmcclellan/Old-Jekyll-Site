Federico Viticci, writing for Macstories:

> In my mind, the next logical move for Workflow is to open up to apps with a new framework that does not require users to edit URL schemes. With a **WorkflowKit** (my own imaginary name), apps could offer some of their functions and data as discrete modules. These actions would allow users to build more complex and yet easier, faster, and safer workflows that let multiple apps collaborate on the same task in a visually automated fashion.

As usual, Federico is able to sum up my feelings and hopes for Workflow with a far more eloquent and thought out explanation. 

I would like be to see his best case scenario come to fruition. I think it's what Apple needs to do to advance iOS as a platform. However, I'm prepping for the worst case scenario by working on new Python Scripts in [Pythonista](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog) to replace my most important Workflows. It helps me learn programming and gives me a rainy day fallback.
