Today is my 30th birthday. I think there is a cultural tendency for people to get freaked out by birthdays ending in zeroes, and I get that. But I'm actually doing really well today. While my life isn't perfect by any means, it is great.

I feel like a lot of your 20s are trying to get life settled and figure out who the grownup version of you is going to be. A lot of the anxiety I see in people hitting 30 is not having a lot of that figured out[^1]. I'm fortunate to enter my 30s with a great marriage, family, and job. I know there will be difficult times ahead, but they will happen on top of a firm foundation.

That being said, I'm not done learning and growing. My next project in life will be teaching myself to program. I have fallen in love with writing code through using apps like [Workflow](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation-made-simple/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog), then moving onto [Pythonista](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog) and [Swift Playgrounds](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog). I want to take the next step and understand how the apps I love are made, and see if I can even write one of my own.

I am again reworking this website into a blog to be able to document the process of learning to code as well as post about everything I don't share over at [The Class Nerd](http://theclassnerd.com) like thoughts on Apple, TV shows, movies, and music. I have also been inspired by Manton Reece's work on [indie microblogging](http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html), and this site will serve as the host for my [micro.blog](http://micro.blog) account when the service launches later this year.

I'm excited about this next decade of my life, and thankful for all of you who reads what I write here. Here's to the next adventure.
