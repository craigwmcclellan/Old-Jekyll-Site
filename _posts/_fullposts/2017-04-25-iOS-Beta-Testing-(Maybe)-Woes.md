I have kept my [iPad Pro Devices](https://mobile.twitter.com/pschiller/status/725791354769399808) running on the iOS Public Beta essentially as long as I've had them. Though I know why I do it with major iOS releases, I have no idea why I continue to subject myself to the frustration with minor point releases.

The latest issue I've had has been with the Smart Keyboard cover and my lock screen. For a few weeks, my Smart Keyboard has been undetected by my iPad a majority of the time to where the software keyboard pops up when I attempt to enter text anywhere. I've also had an issue with [my lock screen flickering like it's charging](https://twitter.com/craigmcclellan/status/856580755480346626) even when nothing is plugged into the lightning port.

I kept updated beta builds would fix the issue, but unfortunately, even yesterday's latest release did little to solve the problem. In fact, this morning my iPad started being so slow and unresponsive on simple things like opening the settings app that I decided to nuke and pave the whole device...with one caveat. I couldn't revert back to the public iOS 10.3.1.

Fortunately, this reset has solved my problem (so far). My iPad is running faster than it has in a long time. I'm curious if this was a result of the restore from iCloud I did after [my wife borrowed my iPad for a week](https://theclassnerd.com/the-singlepad-lifestyle-6009b2595f84) instead of a beta issue. Or maybe it's a combination of both.

I also took the time to layout my home screen in a different way after listening to [yesterday's episode of AppStories](https://overcast.fm/+I5Cn4AmVs). It'll be interesting to see if I like this, or I go back to my old layout.

All of this to say, if you have any issues with your Smart Keyboard or device in general, resetting your iPad may do the trick. With your purchased apps in the App Store already, and most of your data in the cloud, it shouldn't be a difficult process.

*Update: After a few hours of usage, my Smart Keyboard has stopped working again.*
